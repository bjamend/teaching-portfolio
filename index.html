      <p class="body-content">
        Welcome to my physics teaching portfolio!
        This site brings together ideas, philosophies, and educational materials I have developed over the past decade through teaching undergraduate laboratories, delivering guest lectures, tutoring, and providing supplemental instruction.
      <p>
      <p class="body-content">
        I'm a current postdoctoral researcher at Syracuse University, having earned a B.S. in Physics from Miami University in 2019 and a Ph.D. in Physics from Clemson University in 2025, and I am pursuing an instructor or undergraduate laboratory development position at an institution that values teaching and student learning as deeply as I do.
        While I have enjoyed working across a range of courses and laboratory settings, I am particularly drawn to teaching introductory and general-education physics courses that serve students from diverse academic backgrounds.
        I find special satisfaction in helping students who may initially view physics as intimidating discover that its core ideas are accessible, meaningful, and within their reach.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Outside of my academic training, I have experience in graphic design, digital rendering (<a href="https://www.artstation.com/amendbj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.artstation.com/amendbj</a>), and programming that I use to create custom visualizations and web-based interactive modules that allow students to explore physical systems, manipulate parameters, and build intuition through direct engagement.
        These tools are designed to complement hands-on laboratory work and problem solving, helping students connect mathematical descriptions with physical meaning.
        For examples of these interactive modules, check out my digital manual for Clemson University's Physics III Laboratory course here: <a href="https://bjamend.github.io/physics-lab-manual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bjamend.github.io/physics-lab-manual/</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Above all, my goal is to create learning environments in which students feel empowered to ask questions, hone their problem-solving skills, and develop confidence in their ability to understand and do physics.
        I hope the materials collected here reflect my commitment to inclusive, student-centered teaching and to sharing both the intellectual beauty and the broader relevance of physics with a wide range of learners.
      </p>

      <div class="cv-name">Courses:</div>

      The following is a list of courses at Clemson University for which I have developed curricula, created assignments, graded work, and/or supervised students in a laboratory setting.
      Note that some of these roles were concurrent with each other.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>PHYS 2240 - Physics Laboratory III</strong> (Graduate Teacher of Record, 9 semesters)</li>
        <li><strong>PHYS 2230 - Physics Laboratory II</strong> (Teaching Assistant, 2 semesters)</li>
        <li><strong>PHYS 1240 - Physics Laboratory I</strong> (Teaching Assistant, 1 semester)</li>
        <li><strong>PHYS 2220 - Physics with Calculus III</strong> (Teaching Assistant, 3 semesters)</li>
        <li><strong>PHYS 2080 - General Physics II</strong> (Teaching Assistant, 1 summer term)</li>
        <li><strong>PHYS 2001 - Physics for Everyone Laboratory</strong> (Teaching Assistant, 1 summer term)</li>
