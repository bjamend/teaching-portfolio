      <p class="body-content">
        Student feedback from multiple guest lectures and a formal faculty observation indicate that my lecture teaching is characterized by clear communication, strong organization, active learning, and an inclusive classroom climate.
        Students consistently noted that difficult topics, particularly in modern physics and quantum concepts, were presented in a way that was engaging and accessible:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“He made quantum physics accessible—it was interesting and easy to follow.”</li>
        <li>“The content feels intimidating at first but your lecture made this really easy to understand.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        A faculty classroom observation similarly highlighted effective organization, use of real-world analogies, clear pacing, and the integration of active learning strategies such as clicker questions, group discussion, and PhET simulations.
        The observer noted a warm and inclusive classroom environment, intentional questioning with wait time, and strong use of voice, technology, and visual annotation to guide student attention.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Students also emphasized engagement and pacing:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Very engaging instructor…kept the class engaged throughout the entire lecture.”</li>
        <li>“Always talking at a great speed, not too fast or too slow.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        Both student and instructor feedback identified minor areas for refinement, particularly regarding the visibility of in-class demonstrations and making observational goals explicit when using simulations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“I liked the demonstration but I could not see it very well from my seat.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        In response, for future lectures, I will pay closer attention to the physical placement of demonstrations, adding camera projection when appropriate, and will be careful to explicitly state what features students should attend to during simulations and visualizations.
