      <p class="body-content">
        I believe that the fundamental purpose of education is not only to prepare students for specific careers, but to enrich their understanding of the world and their place within it by helping them see more clearly, think more critically, and engage more deeply with how knowledge is constructed.
        Physics, in particular, offers a powerful framework for understanding nature at its most fundamental level, reshaping how students think about space, time, energy, and physical cause and effect.
        Even for those who will never directly apply formal equations in their daily lives, learning physics can profoundly expand one’s intellectual perspective and appreciation for the structure and coherence of the universe.
      <p>
      <p class="body-content">
        Central to my teaching philosophy is the conviction that everyone can learn physics, regardless of background, prior preparation, or identity.
        One of the greatest barriers students face is not the mathematics itself, but the widespread belief that they are "not a math person" or "not a science person."
        Such labels discourage persistence and frame difficulty as evidence of inability rather than as a natural and necessary part of learning.
        I work intentionally to counter this mindset by designing instruction that helps students see that doing physics is a learned skill, not an innate trait.
        My own experience reinforces this belief: as a high school student with strong interests in music and the arts, I did not initially imagine myself pursuing a scientific career.
        Through the influence of an inspiring teacher and sustained engagement with challenging material, I discovered both a love for physics and the confidence to pursue it.
        This did not replace my creative interests, but expanded how I understood creativity and structure in the world, and it shapes my view of students as being capable of growth when given appropriate support and encouragement.

        Central to my teaching philosophy is the conviction that <strong>everyone</strong> can learn physics, regardless of background, prior preparation, or identity.

      <p class="body-content">
        I am especially drawn to teaching physics because of its reputation as a "difficult" subject.
        Rather than accepting this as inevitable, I find great satisfaction in helping students realize that even sophisticated ideas can be conceptually accessible when presented with care and grounded in physical intuition.
        While many students encounter physics primarily because it is a degree requirement, I seek to engage them by appealing to a sense of curiosity and wonder that I believe is universal, even if it has not yet been connected to the subject.
        I cultivate this sense of wonder through activities that invite students to make predictions, test ideas, and see abstract concepts come to life.
        For example, in standing wave experiments, students use a guitar and audio analysis to investigate how fundamental frequencies depend on string length and tension.
        In certain supplemental instruction sessions, students worked in teams to determine the altitude a satellite would need to maintain in order to be tidally locked with the Earth, then tested their predictions in a simulation (Universe Sandbox 2).
        Experiences like these help students see physics not as a collection of formulae, but as a way of asking and answering meaningful questions about the world.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Pedagogically, I believe that students learn best by <em>doing</em> physics.
        Research in physics education, as well as my own classroom experience, consistently shows that active engagement is far more effective than passive listening.
        While clear explanations are important, true understanding develops when students wrestle with problems, articulate their reasoning, and test their ideas.
        For this reason, I favor instructional approaches such as flipped classrooms, structured collaborative problem-solving, and inquiry-based laboratory work, in which class time is devoted to active sense-making rather than one-way transmission of information.
        These approaches also allow students with different backgrounds and levels of preparation to engage with the material through multiple means.
        In my courses, this includes providing multiple representations of key ideas (visual, conceptual, auditory, and mathematical), opportunities to explore phenomena through simulations prior to hands-on work, and laboratory activities that draw on multiple sensory channels so that students can access the same underlying concepts through different modalities.
        In these settings, I view the instructor's role as facilitating student reasoning rather than serving as the sole source of answers.

        I view assessment as an integral part of the learning process rather than solely as a measure of final performance.
        Across tutoring, instructional support, and laboratory settings, I use formative assessment to make students’ thinking visible and to guide their continued development.
        In problem-solving sessions, asking students to explain their reasoning allows misconceptions to be identified and addressed in real time.
        Through my work developing and grading exams for lecture courses, I have sought to design summative assessments that are closely aligned with course objectives, emphasize conceptual understanding over speed, and fairly represent the range of material covered.
        In laboratory courses, pre-lab questions, notebooks, reports, and presentations document students’ experimental reasoning and their ability to synthesize results and reflect on uncertainty.
        Whenever possible, I also allow flexibility in how students demonstrate their understanding, so that assessment emphasizes reasoning and communication rather than a single mode of expression.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        My goals as an instructor are therefore to create an inclusive learning environment that offers multiple entry points into challenging material and affirms the varied experiences students bring to the classroom.
        I seek to scaffold the development of both conceptual understanding and quantitative reasoning, and to foster confidence through productive struggle.
        By emphasizing physical intuition, visual reasoning, and metacognitive skills such as checking assumptions and interpreting errors, I aim to help students become not only more proficient in physics, but more self-aware and resilient learners.
        Physics is a deeply human endeavor: a creative, iterative process of making sense of the world.
        When students come to see themselves as capable participants in that process, they gain not only technical skills, but a lasting sense of intellectual agency and confidence.
