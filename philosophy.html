        My goal as a physics instructor is to help every student see themselves as capable of doing physics and to cultivate that confidence through deliberate practice.
        I strongly believe that success in physics is not an innate trait but a learned skill accessible to everyone, regardless of background, prior preparation, or identity.
        Yet many students arrive having already internalized the belief that they are “not a math person” or “not a science person.”
        This mindset often becomes a larger barrier than the content itself: when difficulty is interpreted as evidence that they do not belong, students disengage before meaningful learning can occur.
        To counter this, I design courses so that improvement comes from regular practice, collaboration, and timely feedback rather than from prior preparation or working alone.
        Class time is devoted primarily to collaborative problem solving, discussion, and guided work rather than extended lecture, creating active, student-centered environments where students articulate their reasoning, hone their problem-solving skills, and refine their understanding with support.
        Working alongside peers also helps students see that confusion and struggle are normal parts of learning physics, not signs that they lack ability.
        My own path into physics, from early interests in music and the arts to discovering the subject through mentorship and sustained effort, reinforces my belief that scientific ability grows through experience rather than identity.

        My approach is strongly informed by physics education research demonstrating that interactive engagement consistently produces higher learning gains and improved retention compared with traditional lecture.
        As an undergraduate, I experienced introductory physics in a SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies)<sup>1</sup> classroom, where most class time was devoted to collaborative problem solving, experimentation, and discussion rather than lecture.
        Working in teams around shared tables, we constructed understanding together instead of passively receiving it.
        That experience shaped my vision of what a physics classroom can be, and the substantial body of evidence supporting SCALE-UP and studio-style instruction (improved conceptual mastery, lower failure rates, and narrower achievement gaps)<sup>2</sup> has only strengthened my commitment to this model.

      <p class="body-content">
        In my own teaching, I have implemented these principles most directly in laboratory courses and supplemental instruction sessions.
        Rather than following prescriptive procedures, students design their own experimental approaches, testing their ideas and iterating through successive trials.
        For example, students have used guitars and audio analysis software to explore standing waves and resonance, or worked in teams to determine the orbital conditions required for a tidally locked satellite before testing their predictions in simulation. These activities require students to reason from first principles and connect mathematics to physical behavior, reinforcing that physics is something they do, not something they watch.
        By positioning students as investigators rather than recipe-followers, these experiences build both conceptual understanding and scientific confidence.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        In future lecture courses, I plan to extend this philosophy through a flipped, SCALE-UP-style structure, to the extent that the layout of the classroom permits.
        Regardless of the structure of the physical classroom, core content, including short videos, readings, and guided notes, will be available outside of class so that in-person time can focus on the work that most benefits from interaction: solving problems and addressing misconceptions together.
        In this model, homework becomes primarily formative rather than high-stakes.
        The most challenging learning occurs while actively working through problems, yet traditional course structures often ask students to do this work alone, with limited feedback or support.
        By moving more of that problem solving into the classroom, where peers and instructors are available to help, students can engage more deeply with the material and receive immediate guidance.
        This approach encourages genuine reasoning and persistence while creating an environment in which learning is supported rather than left to chance or, in some cases, ChatGPT or Chegg.
        I will regularly evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies through student feedback, performance trends, and reflection on common misconceptions, using this evidence to refine activities and course structure each term.

        When students leave a course confident in their ability to tackle unfamiliar problems and develop solutions independently, they have truly developed the habits of mind and sense of agency that define a physicist.

      <p class="body-content">
        Equally important is ensuring that these environments are accessible to students with diverse backgrounds, preparation levels, and learning preferences.
        I draw on principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL)<sup>3</sup>, which emphasize providing multiple ways for students to engage with material, access information, and demonstrate understanding.
        Many physics curricula have not historically been designed with these principles in mind<sup>4</sup>, which can create unnecessary barriers for some students; addressing this gap is therefore an important priority in my own teaching.
        In my labs, I maintain an online manual that integrates interactive simulations, visualizations, and written explanations, used alongside hands-on experimentation.
        Students may synthesize their learning through reports, presentations, posters, or computational projects, allowing them to communicate their reasoning in different formats.
        In future courses, I will continue to provide core materials in multiple formats so that students can engage with new ideas in the ways that work best for them.
        Lecture content will be available in both written and video form, allowing students to review explanations at their own pace, revisit challenging topics, and access the material outside of scheduled class time.
        I will also design assignments with clarity and accessibility in mind by explicitly defining symbols and including brief reminders of relevant background concepts as needed so that success does not depend on prior familiarity with implicit conventions.
        These practices reduce unnecessary barriers while maintaining rigorous expectations consistent with university standards.

      <p class="body-content">
        By focusing on active learning, collaborative problem-solving, and UDL principles, I strive to foster an inclusive learning environment that provides multiple entry points into challenging material and values the varied experiences students bring to the classroom.
        When students leave a course confident in their ability to tackle unfamiliar problems and develop solutions independently, they have truly developed the habits of mind and sense of agency that define a physicist.
        Helping students reach the point where they see themselves as capable problem solvers is the central purpose of my teaching.
