      <h2 class="section-header">Lab Evaluations</h2>

      <p class="body-content">
        This summary synthesizes student evaluations from ten semesters of undergraduate physics laboratory instruction at Clemson University, spanning Spring 2021 through Spring 2025.
        During this period, I served both as Instructor of Record for Physics Lab III and as a Teaching Assistant for Physics Lab I and III.
        Across all offerings, quantitative ratings were consistently very high (typically 4.8–5.0/5 on five-point Likert scales) in categories including clarity of explanation, organization, communication of expectations, feedback, and student engagement, with scores exceeding college and departmental averages in nearly every category.
        Beyond numerical ratings, the following open-ended student comments reveal several recurring themes that characterize my teaching approach and its impact on student learning.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Students most frequently emphasized the clarity of my explanations and my ability to make difficult material accessible:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Makes the labs very simple to understand, answers questions clearly and tells us exactly what he is looking for.”</li>
        <li>“Ben was awesome to have in the lab when he was available, very helpful and made difficult concepts much more digestible.”</li>
        <li>“His teaching is super coherent and easy to follow, even when explaining super complicated concepts.”</li>
        <li>“Ben’s greatest strength is his ability to break down the oftentimes difficult concepts of physics into something more manageable.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        These comments align with consistently high scores on items related to explanation of concepts, communication, and intellectual support, and reflect my emphasis on building physical intuition, explicitly connecting procedures to underlying principles, and encouraging students to articulate their reasoning during lab activities.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Another dominant theme is clear communication of expectations and strong course organization:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“He clearly communicated what he wanted… very clear about what is expected of you.”</li>
        <li>“Explains exactly what is expected of us very well. We’re never left confused as to what our lab procedure looks like.”</li>
        <li>“The concise and easy to understand summary of what we had to do in the lab prior to it beginning.”</li>
        <li>“Everything was related to the lab and explained super thoroughly.”</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        “He was able to lead us to the answer instead of just giving it to us.”
      </div>

      <p class="body-content">
        These remarks are consistent with high quantitative ratings for organization, clarity of learning outcomes, and alignment between assignments and objectives, and reflect my focus on well-scaffolded pre-lab preparation, explicit rubrics, and structured in-class workflow.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Students also repeatedly commented on the classroom climate and my approachability:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“His openness for questions and how he went through the lab each lab helped me learn a lot better. He was very understanding… and made lab an enjoyable experience.”</li>
        <li>“He encouraged all students to be active in the lab and enjoy learning.”</li>
        <li>“Ben is really good at answering students’ questions in a way that helps us think through the problem, but he doesn’t abandon us. He guides us to the answer.”</li>
        <li>“His ability to connect with students.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        These comments reflect my emphasis on guided inquiry, formative questioning, and creating a low-stakes environment in which students feel comfortable exploring ideas, making mistakes, and refining their understanding.
      </p>

      <p class="body-content">
        Students frequently highlighted the quality of feedback and the way assistance was structured to promote independent reasoning:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“He was able to lead us to the answer instead of just giving it to us.”</li>
        <li>“Guides us to the answer, which I think helped me with my problem-solving skills.”</li>
        <li>“He would walk around and check in on everyone’s progress and explain anything we were stuck on.”</li>
        <li>“Very timely and thorough in his responses… very fast when grading.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        These remarks align with consistently strong ratings for feedback quality and clarity of grading, and reflect my use of formative assessment, in-lab coaching, and transparent evaluation criteria.
      </p>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        "He'd make a great professor one day."
      </div>

      <p class="body-content">
        Several students offered global assessments that capture the cumulative effect of these practices:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Easily the most cohesive and enjoyable lab I have taken at Clemson thus far.”</li>
        <li>“Ben Amend has definitely been the best TA I have ever had.”</li>
        <li>“This was my best lab yet!”</li>
        <li>“He’d make a great professor one day.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        Student feedback has also informed the evolution of my teaching.
        In early offerings of the laboratory course, I intentionally provided minimal procedural instruction, with the goal of encouraging students to develop independence in navigating unfamiliar tools, mirroring authentic research practice.
        Some students, however, noted that this exploratory approach could consume too substantial a fraction of in-class time, to the point where there was not enough time left to iterate on their procedures and improve their measurements.
        Additionally, there were a few instances were students felt as though my expectations for graded work were unclear:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“Sometimes his explanations were a little short for some labs.”</li>
        <li>“In many cases when it came to grading, criteria was not clearly outlined.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-content">
        Reflecting on this feedback, I refined the balance between guided instruction and productive struggle.
        In later iterations of the course, I introduced short software walkthroughs, annotated example workflows, and clearer pre-lab scaffolding, while still requiring students to consult documentation and make independent analytical decisions.
        This adjustment preserved the goal of fostering technical autonomy while reducing unproductive friction and allowing more class time to be devoted to conceptual interpretation and experimental reasoning.
        I also consulted with other instructors on best practices for grading rubrics, particularly as they pertained to the lab notebooks (the biggest source of uncertainty), and revised my student-facing grading policies accordingly.
        Subsequent comments emphasizing clearer expectations, smoother lab flow, and strong conceptual support suggest that this recalibration improved the learning experience.
