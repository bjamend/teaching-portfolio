        Much of my laboratory development work has gone into Clemson's Physics III Lab (waves, optics, and modern physics).
        For this course, I developed a fully virtual lab manual that can be accessed here: <a href="https://bjamend.github.io/physics-lab-manual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bjamend.github.io/physics-lab-manual/</a>.
        My primary goal in creating the manual in this format was to present the content in multiple different modalities (i.e. standard reading, visual aids, auditory cues, and interactive simulations) to make the content more accessible to all students.
        As a byproduct, that the fully virtual 'experiments' offer digital representations of each lab allows for greater flexibility in course modality, particularly in the event of student or instructor illness, inclement weather, or facility closures.
        I highly encourage anyone perusing this site to check out the manual, and to try out some of the interactive modules yourself!

        Below I've also attached a sample syllabus for this course.

        One multi-week project that I typically worked on with my students (not included in the digital lab manual yet) was the assembly of a makeshift spectrometer.
        This setup consisted of a simple photodiode circuit that measured light intensity at different positions along a diffraction patern, allowing the students to calculate the wavelengths from geometric arguments.
        Shown below is a student presentation on the assembly and usage of this spectrometer setup, anonymized where necessary (hence a few slides are missing).
        The students delivered this presentation as a general mini-colloquium to all members of the department who were interested in observing.

        Outside of this course, I also contributed to the lab for "Physics for Everyone", a physics lecture + laboratory course for non-science majors.
        I wrote/modified several of the labs for this course, produced diagrams and other visual aids, and formatted the entire lab manual.
        Shown below is one entry that I wrote, though the entire manual is available upon reasonable request.
